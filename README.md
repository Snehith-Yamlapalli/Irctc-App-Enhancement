# IRCTC Application Enhancement
The project aims to upgrade the IRCTC application by enhancing its booking capacity and incorporating an intuitive seat selection feature.
1) We increased the booking capacity to 12 members per booking.
2) Seat selection feature will provide passengers with the flexibility to choose their preferred seats based on specific factors
- Like proximity to exits
- Availability of window seats
- Location within the coach.
3) And you can Upgrade your ticket from lower tier to upper tier while you are travelling in the train.
  
 **By implementing
 these upgrades, the IRCTC app is positioned to deliver a more reliable
 and satisfying user experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction**
